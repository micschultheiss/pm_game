# TODO

Working backlog. Active items live here; longer-form requirements live in [docs/Hallucination_Inc_PRD.md](docs/Hallucination_Inc_PRD.md).

## Now

(empty — pull from Next)

## Next

- [ ] Add one or two new event categories (e.g. open-source model release, hiring freeze)
- [ ] Surface why a productive move is unavailable when bankruptcy fires
- [ ] Brand Asset Generator still uneconomical — despite the buff, only 15 builds (0.6% share) across 1000 planner runs. 100% conversion when built, so demand is fine; recipe economics still don't compete. Try: lower Code requirement, raise base value, or add a higher-tier client to its wants list.
- [ ] Compliance Dashboard drift/decay — 24% of planner builds but only 52% conversion across 1000 runs. The 6-day build outpaces drift/decay; half end up unsellable. Options: shorten craft_days to 5, lower decay sensitivity for slow products, or split into two cheaper variants.
- [ ] Check token prices and software prices ratios and align with real world numbers

## Later / ideas

- [ ] Optional local session summary file for tracking runs
- [ ] End-of-run "what if" replay showing the best missed move
- [ ] Think about different pricing models like yearly licences, seat based pricing etc
- [ ] Externalize `_games` to Redis or SQLite so deploys / multi-worker / scale-to-zero stop wiping in-progress runs

## Done

- [x] Add smoke tests for `web.py` — `test_web.py` covers the welcome → game flow, each action route round-trip + validation branches, `/new` reset, the stale-session bailout, every view helper, and both end screens. Added to the coverage gate; 100% on 208 stmts. Total suite now 190 tests.
- [x] Publish the web frontend on Fly.io (`hallucination-inc.fly.dev`) — first `fly launch` + `fly deploy` ran against the config from [ADR 004](docs/adr/004-deployment-flyio.md) (Dockerfile + fly.toml, region fra, single warm machine).
- [x] Wire GitHub Actions deploy pipeline — [.github/workflows/fly-deploy.yml](.github/workflows/fly-deploy.yml) runs `flyctl deploy --remote-only` on every push to `main`.
- [x] Step 4 of engine split — `web.py` Flask frontend reusing the engine. Routes for buy/craft/sell/travel/next/borrow/pay/new; in-memory state keyed by a cookie session id; Jinja2 template + CSS that mirror the terminal layout (banner, market grid, contracts table, action menu). `python3 hallucination_inc.py --web` dispatches into it; default still runs the terminal. Engine and terminal stay stdlib-only — Flask is the only project dep, pinned in `requirements.txt`. Smoke-tested end to end via Flask dev server + curl.
- [x] Step 3 of engine split — split `test_hallucination_inc.py` into `test_engine.py` (engine logic) + `test_terminal.py` (UI), with shared fixtures in `test_helpers.py`. Tests now import `engine` / `terminal` directly. `hallucination_inc.py` shed its re-export shim and is now a 15-line launcher (`from terminal import main; main()`). 154 tests still pass; coverage unchanged (92.7% engine, 96.0% terminal).
- [x] Step 2 of engine split — UI moved into its own `terminal.py`; `hallucination_inc.py` is now a thin entry-point launcher plus a transitional compat shim for `import hallucination_inc as g`. Dropped a stray duplicate `compute_market_demand` that lived in both engine and terminal. Coverage gate now tracks `engine.py` + `terminal.py` (the launcher is pure import-time glue, not worth gating). 154 tests still pass; coverage 92.7% engine, 96.0% terminal.
- [x] Step 1 of engine split — extracted `engine.py` (pure logic), kept `hallucination_inc.py` as terminal frontend re-exporting engine surface for test compatibility. Added `is_bankrupt` / `is_game_over` oracles. simulate.py now imports `engine` directly. 154 tests still pass; coverage 91% engine, 95.5% terminal.
- [x] Add unit tests + 90% stdlib coverage gate wired into pre-commit (current: 95.6% on hallucination_inc.py, 154 tests)
- [x] Make empty enter the next turn
- [x] Rebalance the game mechanics (planner win 44% → 58%, median NW $35K → $169K after 5-variant pass)
- [x] Sort the travel destinations (customers as on the customer list)
- [x] Randomize starting provider — each run opens at a different lab
- [x] Show full provider price grid consistently — always on the dashboard and at the top of the travel menu (peer to the open-contracts board)
- [x] Widen lower-tier price variance — dropped the $5 floor that was flatlining Google/Mistral/Meta to a uniform $5
- [x] Tune debt interest vs. starting cash after recent rebalance (5% → 3% + debt-free bonus)
- [x] Buff Brand Asset Generator — added to Walmart/Salesforce wants, base value $55K → $65K (share 0.3% → 1.0%)
- [x] Rescue Meta provider — quality 0.50 → 0.55 (now visited 181 times in 10K planner games)
- [x] ~~Rescue Mistral provider~~ — resolved by the price-variance fix; 1000-run planner sim shows Mistral 173 visits vs. Meta 108, so Mistral is no longer eclipsed
- [x] More client templates (mid-market, agency, startup) — added TechCrunch Startups, Local Gov Council, Etsy
